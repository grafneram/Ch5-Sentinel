Sentinel

Using the while/sentinel approach, write a program that will read a line and print that line in all caps until it reaches a line containing only the word 'quit'.

Sample run:

Jack be nimble

JACK BE NIMBLE

Jack be quick

JACK BE QUICK

Jack jump over the candlestick

JACK JUMP OVER THE CANDLESTICK

quit
